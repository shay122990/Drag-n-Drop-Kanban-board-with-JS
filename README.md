# Drag n'Drop Kanban Board with JS

## About The Project

So this is essentially a frontend project management to-do board built with vanilla JavaScript. <br/>
You have four columns. One for upcoming items, one fop current, one for completed and one for hold. You can move items between these columns by drag n'drop method. You can add new items in each of the columns. You can click on an excisting item and modify it. To delete it, you can click on an item and backspace it and that removes the item.<br/>
The session is saved in your localStorage, so if you refresh and come back, everything will be displayed as you left it. <br/>
This is a useful project to learn the methods and you can apply these methods in your own builds.

## Built With <br/>

You should be familiar with JavaScript basics such as arrays, loops, conditions, events, DOM, functions and operators. Below I have linked methods and tools used for this project. <br/>

- [CSS scroll styling](https://css-tricks.com/the-current-state-of-styling-scrollbars/)
- [Drag n'Drop API](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp)

- [Focus event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/focusout_event)

## Installation

This is a working code example.
You can copy the CSS and Javascript code as is and use it in your projects.
Or you can download the code as a ZIP file and unzip it. No web server required, you can see it live through your localhost by opening index.html with your browser. Alternatively, you can open your project with VS Code (download live server extension) and click on **Go Live** at the bottom right corner, it should open in your default browser.
